    more poeple began to realise how great Shaf-Co. was.<br><br>The company got its name from his love of shark fins. So he combined the two words to make
    the name of his company. The 'Co.' part is failory obvious. The name is now a household name across the globe.<br><br>The business is also very known form
    huge care for their customers; the people working at Shaf-Co. know how important it is to show their customers how much they mean to them. This began when
    Mr. Jackson fell in love with one of his early customers, who he is now married to. From that point on, he made sure everyone working there appreciates their
    users.<br><br>Over the years, Shaf-Co. has won lots of awards, such as 'Best Company Ever', 'Best Owner Ever', 'Best Value Ever', etc. This comes down to

    <h2>The Man Behind the Curtains - Jake Jackson</h2>
    <p>Before Shaf-Co. there was a young boy, who's name was Jake Jackson. This young boy never had a clue that his destiniy lied with being the grand leader
    and founder of Shaf-Co., the networking company that cares about you!<br><br>He came from a humble beginning, growing up in a small town near Manchester, UK.
    From the start, young Jackson had a love for computers and spent his early youth modifying his mum's computer. This was something he got into at the age of 4.
    He was simply a child prodigy, who learnt everything he knew about computers on his own. He never needed the help of others because he was simply that smart.<br><br>
    A few years later, when he reached high school, he extended his passion of computers into networking! From then on, he spent his free time learning about networking and
    covered the country looking at some of England's biggest and best networks available.<br><br>He then built his own network, which was originally meant for his own
    house, but then became a network for his entire street. Then, his town. Soon after, it took over his city. Next the whole of England. Now the world! </p>
